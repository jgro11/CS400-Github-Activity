A guy named Joe was on a road trip to visit some friends who lived across the country. It was getting late, and he was still hours away, so he decided to check into a nearby motel. When he walked up to the front desk and asked for a room, the employee at the desk told him he should find somewhere else to stay, as the only room they had available was supposedly haunted by the ghost of a man who had died there. 
After driving for nearly 9 hours with just two 20 minute breaks in between, Joe was very exhausted. As an ex Marine, he really wasn't afraid of ghosts. He told the receptionsit ,"Once marine always a marine. I ain't got scared of nothing". He made himself a coffee and went upstairs. When he got to his room however, things felt a little weird. The room was too clean. Way too clean. Although this motel was very old, this room felt like it was built pretty recently. 
Joe was exhausted from all the driving so he deicde he would just get ready for bed. Once he got underneath the covers, Joe started hearing noises in the wall behind him. It sounded like someone was yelling for help. Joe wasn't afraid. He banged on the wall a few times and suddenly the noises stopped. Then Joe peacefully went to sleep and went on his merry way the next day.
